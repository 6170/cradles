##Plan
### Goals
Create a application to help teachers find volunteers for their classrooms.

### Stakeholders
1. George Erickson - Developer
2. David Benhaim - Developer

### Reasources
1. Load Balanced Production Setup (Most Likely going to use EC2)
2. Staging Server setup on free heroku for demoing

### Tasks
1. Create MVP (George and David)
2. Provision Production Server (George)
3. Setup server monitoring (George)

### Risks
1. Creating a resilient server setup - this will be mitigated by consulting friends who have a lot more experience in this area.

### Minimal Viable Product

##Team Contract

##Reflection
###Evaluation
- We have worked together previously, which makes this project much easier.
- Both extremely busy with other jobs made it very difficult to meet, but working remotely went well.
###Lessons Learned
- Corporations work much slower than the scope of a class.
- Also difficult to meet with a real customer when both of our schedules are so packed.
