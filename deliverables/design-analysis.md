# Design Analysis

## Overview

### Key Design Challenges

1. Making the service useful for teachers and volunteers
2. Making "good" connections between teachers and volunteers
3. Making an intuitive app ui/ux
4. How to handle scheduling (data representation+ interface + matching)
5. Making the volunteers searchable

### Key design decisions
Our app has the potential to make a big difference in the lives of the teachers, volunteers and most importantly the children we are trying to help. Making the application usable and simple is one of our big design goals. If the application makes the teacher's lives harder in any way its not doing its job. It is imperative that the interface be obvious and intuitive. Additionally one of the biggest features is the matching between volunteers and volunteer opportunities. Both the visual representation and interface for the scheduling need to be spot on. Additionally the backend that handles the matching needs to perform. Because of these requirements we have elected to make the interface to the problem as simple as possible. We have looked at other scheduling apps and borrowed ideas from their designs to use in our own implemntation. These ideas include allowing specific dates and times to be specified along with repeated availability, location and proximity specifications and class topic and age requests. Additionally we are implementing a feature that allows teachers to review volunteers to help weed out bad volunteers (or to improve matching).
