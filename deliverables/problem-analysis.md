#Problem Analysis

##Overview
### Purpose and goals
Many teachers in poorer school districts have found that having a volunteer aid in the classroom makes a tremendous difference. It doesn't matter if the volunteer was knowledgable in the subject matter. All they had to do was be there for the kids. These volunteers make a big difference in the lives of many students. 

The only problem is that it is difficult to organize and train these volunteers. Most of the effort falls on the already overworked teachers. We hope to make an application that aids teachers in the registration, training and scheduling of classroom volunteers. We want to provide a portal through which willing volunteers can be linked to the teachers that need them the most.

### Unusual requirements
In Massachusetts all public school volunteers must pass a CORI background check, while outside the scope of our application it would be nice to make the background check process as easy as possible for all parties involved.

### Key features
- A volunteer profile page where prospective volunteers can list information about their location, interests and availibility.
- A volunteer search page that allows teachers to search for the volunteer that they think would be right for their class.
- A volunteer review page that allows teachers to leave reviews about volunteers that they have interacted with.
- A favorites page where a teacher can view the availibility of there favorite volunteers.
